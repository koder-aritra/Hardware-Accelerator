# AI Accelerator for Convolution and Matrix Multiplication

This project presents the design and implementation of an AI accelerator optimized for efficient convolution and matrix multiplication operations. The accelerator is designed as part of a larger System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, seamlessly integrating with a CPU via AXI4 bus interfaces for task configuration, data transfer, and result retrieval.

## Key Features

- **AXI4 Slave Interface**: Allows the CPU to configure and control the accelerator's operation by writing to specific registers.
- **Controller**: Orchestrates the overall operation of the AI accelerator, managing data flow and controlling the execution of convolution and matrix multiplication operations.
- **AXI4 Master Interface**: Enables the accelerator to access external memory (e.g., DRAM) for fetching input data and storing output data.
- **Input & Weight Memory**: Stores input data (e.g., images or feature maps) and convolution kernels or weights required for computation.
- **Output Memory**: Stores the results of convolution and matrix multiplication operations.
- **Processing Elements**: Each processing element constitutes a 9x9 grid, capable of performing maximum matrix multiplication of 9x9 and convolution operations with a kernel size of 3x3.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Implements interrupt mechanisms to signal task completion, enabling efficient coordination between the CPU and the accelerator.

## Design Specifications

- **Memory Map for AXI Slave Interface**: Defines the memory-mapped registers for configuring and controlling the accelerator.
- **Memory Architecture**: Utilizes a 9x9 shift register configuration for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
